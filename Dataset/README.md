#  7Scenes Dataset

The 7Scenes dataset is a widely used benchmark for evaluating vision-based camera localization methods. It contains sequences of RGB-D images captured in seven different indoor scenes with a handheld Kinect RGB-D camera. Each scene presents various challenges such as motion blur, varying lighting conditions, and texture-less surfaces, making it ideal for testing the robustness of camera localization algorithms.

#  12Scenes Dataset

The 12Scenes dataset is another comprehensive benchmark for camera localization, designed for large-scale indoor environments. It consists of sequences of RGB-D images captured in 12 different scenes, providing a more diverse set of challenges than the 7Scenes dataset, including longer sequences and more complex geometry. This dataset is ideal for testing localization algorithms in more intricate environments.
