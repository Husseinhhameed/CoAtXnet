# 7Scenes Dataset

The 7Scenes dataset is a widely used benchmark for evaluating vision-based camera localization methods. It contains sequences of RGB-D images captured in seven different indoor scenes with a handheld Kinect RGB-D camera. Each scene presents various challenges such as motion blur, varying lighting conditions, and texture-less surfaces, making it ideal for testing the robustness of camera localization algorithms.

## Scenes
